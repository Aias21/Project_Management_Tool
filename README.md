# Project_Management_Tool
### This project is divided in three different and independent branches, with each of them adding more logic and functionality to it
### The <b>main</b> branch is the project built at the end of SQL and RDBMS module and it's supposed to showcase my understanding of building a database architecture for a tracking tool. 
### In <b>psycopg2</b> branch I use this module and Python logic to execute CRUD operations on the same project
### In the <b>django</b>, the project is supposed to take shape and turn it into a usable tool for the users
#### ...work in progress
